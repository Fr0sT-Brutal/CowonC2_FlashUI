Modification of the original Main menu UI.
Author: Fr0sT
Current version — 0.4

This is beta — bugs are possible! Nevertheless it's just a flash application, nothing serious should happen.

Changes:

* You can change wallpapers, 5 images in the set
* Icon labels are drawn as text not as graphic
* Confirmation popup changed

Installation
 Put the mainmenu1.swf into {player}/System/Flash UI folder.

Uninstallation
 Remove the mainmenu1.swf file (or simply rename it to, for instance, mainmenu1_1.swf)
