Modification of the original Music UI.
Author: Fr0sT
Current version — 0.12

This is beta — bugs are possible! Nevertheless it's just a flash application, nothing serious should happen.

Changes:

* Cover rotation on playback disabled (but remained on track change)
* Infobar (upper bar where volume, battery etc are) enlarged. Labels are drawn as text not as images (sharper). Borders rounded. Images taken from main menu.
* Artist label enlarged
* Current time/total time labels are drawn as text (sharper and larger; hour part is ignored if zero)
* Controls and progress-bar from the "red screen" moved to the main screen (no excess tap to get them shown). "Red screen" is removed.
* "Tools" button added, shows "Blue screen"
* Progress-bar slider could be moved when paused
* Current time label shows minus when the mode is "Time remain". Tabable; changes the mode on tap and saves it to the player settings.
* Autoresume - start playback on application start (if set in settings). The feature that for some reason has been underimplemented by Cowon.
* Current track deletion (from Tools menu). Confirmation popup contains track file name in the message
* Popups improved
* Full info about current track (bitrate, codec, filename, etc)
* "Current track # / Total tracks" label and progress-bar on "blue screen" are removed
* Visual updates optimized, no more updates of currently invisible layers

Installation
 Put the music.swf into {player}/System/Flash UI folder.
