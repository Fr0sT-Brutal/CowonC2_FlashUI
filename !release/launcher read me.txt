Modification of the original Launcher Flash application (not UI).
Author: Fr0sT
Current version — 0.2

This is beta — bugs are possible! Nevertheless it's just a flash application, nothing serious should happen.

Changes:

* Resume mode working! Launches last used application on startup.

Installation
 Put the launcher.swf into {player}/System/Flash UI folder.

Uninstallation
 Remove the launcher.swf file (or simply rename it to, for instance, launcher_1.swf)
